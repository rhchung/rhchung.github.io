	<p>Hello! I'm Rachel H Chung, a creative who started in music, moved to design in tech, and recently dabbled in the DIY. Writing, however, is an unexplored sport for me. So bear with me and my occasional spelling and grammatical scuffs, as what I intend to share with you is visual journey supported by words and not the other way around. With that said, hope this delights you.</p>
