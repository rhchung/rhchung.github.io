			<h2>About</h2>
			<h5>I'm a UX designer with a passion for design thinking, social innovation, and creative education. I graduated from Stanford University with a B.S. in Science, Technology, and Society with Honors holding skills in the design process, project management, visual design, UX/UI, and curriculum design. Recently, I was featured in Fast Company Leadership and on IDEO Futures and was a speaker at SXSWedu 2016 as a founding member of a mobile design studio (Girls Driving for a Difference) that uses design thinking to empower young girls across America to become leaders of social change. I believe that users inspire innovation and that design should be elegantly intuitive. I love needfinding, rapid prototyping, teaching, cartooning, and dissecting challenging problems. I also love dogs, boba, piano, and cool tech.</h5>
